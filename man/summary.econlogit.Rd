\title{This gives regression output for the econlogit model. Anova is output along with a coefficient test (with the specified errors), $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$ and residual standard error. Note that the residual standard error is done assuming homoskedastic standard errors. This is called by the \code{\link{reg}} function if \code{quietly = FALSE} or can be called manually.}
\usage{
\method{summary}{econlogit}(econlogit)
}
\arguments{
\item{econlogit}{An econlogit object as created by the \code{\link{logit}} function.}
}
\value{
This does not return anything. A summary is printed to the console.
